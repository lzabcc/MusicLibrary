Our "Music Library Management System" project aims to create a music information management system similar to iTunes. The system primarily involves the management of artists, music tracks, albums, and music libraries. 

I have designed four primary classes: Artist, MusicTrack, Album, and MusicLibrary. These classes represent the main entities of the system. Additionally, to enhance system efficiency, I implemented two key strategies. Firstly, I utilized HashMaps to optimize the common task of searching for specific music tracks and artists within a large collection. By storing music tracks and artist objects as key-value pairs, with names as keys, I streamlined the retrieval process, significantly improving the efficiency of track and artist lookups in the Music Library. Secondly, I replaced direct output operations with logs to reduce I/O overhead. Moving on to Extension 2, I employed four algorithms: "First Fit," "Best Fit," "Worst Fit," and "First Fit Decreasing." Although I attempted to implement the "Simulated Annealing Algorithm" for optimization, I encountered challenges and ultimately reverted to the aforementioned algorithms.
